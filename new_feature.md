The new deature I attempted to add was a button title "Finish Workout". Clicking this button would reset the "Exercise Logging" page back to its original state "Start Workout" and move over the completed workout and associated data to the history tab. There was an iteration of the code where the all the tabs were on a single page with no navigation where the finish workout button worked. However, after switching to a navigation tab based structure, GPT was unable to get the button to work again (3 tries).
